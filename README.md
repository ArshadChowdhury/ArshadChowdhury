## About Me

I am a versatile Full-Stack Software Engineer with more than three years of experience crafting clean, user-centric web applications. My journey is defined by a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and a commitment to modern development practices.

With a robust technical foundation across the entire stack, I specialize in the React/Next.js & Angular ecosystem for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js/Nest.js for building scalable backends. My expertise extends to both Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, allowing me to architect efficient, data-driven solutions from the ground up. I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and am highly adaptable to new technologies. Whether I’m refining the user experience on the frontend or optimizing complex logic on the backend, my focus remains the same: delivering high-quality, performant, and maintainable code. I am always open to meaningful collaborations where I can contribute my technical skills and work ethic to a forward-thinking team.


## Skills  

### Technical Expertise & Architectural Philosophy

I specialize in building scalable, maintainable systems by adhering to SOLID principles and Clean Architecture. My approach focuses on decoupling business logic from framework-specific implementation to ensure long-term code quality.

#### Frontend Development - 

Core Stack: Expert in React / Next.js & Angular, utilizing TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS/SCSS for responsive, modern UI design.

Design Patterns: I implement the Container/Presentational pattern to separate logic from view and utilize Custom Hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic.

State Management: Experienced in managing complex application states using Zustand, Redux and TanStack Query for efficient server-state synchronization.

#### Backend Development

Core Stack: Highly proficient in Node.js/Express.js and Nest.js, building robust RESTful APIs.

Design Patterns: I leverage Nest.js’s built-in Dependency Injection (DI) and Module-based architecture to create highly testable and modular backends. I frequently use the Repository Pattern to abstract data access logic and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for strict request validation.

Database Management: Skilled in architecting schemas for both Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, prioritizing query optimization and data integrity.

#### Problem Solving & Learning

Foundations: Strong command of Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent practice in C/C++, which informs my approach to efficient code execution.

Principles: Committed to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles to reduce technical debt.


## Experience  

I have built a career focused on rapid adaptability and technical excellence, moving from specialized frontend role to comprehensive full-stack engineering.

## Highlights & Open Source Contributions

An active proponent of the open-source ecosystem. Contributed to several projects during Hacktoberfest, gaining hands-on experience in the collaborative lifecycle from forking & codebase navigation to effective communication and Pull Request (PR) management. Currently deepening core programming foundations through rigorous study of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and problem-solving to architect more efficient, high-performance software. Experienced in translating complex technical requirements into actionable development tasks and maintaining clear communication across cross-functional teams.
